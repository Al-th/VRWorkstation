VR Workstation
=============

VR Workstation is a project aimed to recreate a 3D Virtual Workstation. The goal is to reproduce an environment to provide multi-screen to people that own a VR headset like Oculus Rift

This work is based on windows api (WinApi), and OpenGL. 

Modify main.cpp to fetch the window you want to capture. Current version retrieve windows thanks to their name, currently a french mspaint.exe window with no title "Sans titre - Paint".
